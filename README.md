## Local development

### 1) Prerequisites

Install Ruby and build tools (Ubuntu/Debian):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
gem install bundler
```

### 2) Install dependencies

From the repository root:

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3) Run the blog locally

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Default local URLs:

- <http://127.0.0.1:4000>
- <http://localhost:4000>

Useful variants:

```bash
# Enable live reload
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload

# Use a custom port
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 8080
```

### 4) Build static output

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

Generated files are written to `_site/`.

## Writing and editing content

- Add or edit Markdown files in the repository root or relevant content folders.
- Use front matter at the top of each Markdown file to control layout/metadata.
- Default page layout is configured in `_config.yml` (`layout: default` for pages).
- Update shared UI elements through `_includes/` and page wrappers in `_layouts/`.

## Notes

- `README.md` is excluded from published site output via `_config.yml`.
- `theme: null` is used, with `remote_theme` and local Sass/custom assets for styling.
- `webrick` is included for local Ruby 3/Jekyll serving compatibility.
- This site is inspired by the Stanford course websites for **CS231**, **CS103**, and **CS107**.
